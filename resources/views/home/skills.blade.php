                        then moved into a career within the Probation Service, wherein I progressed from administration to managing
                        a large team of administra
                        tors. All of these roles involved working in a high-pressured environment and
                        therefore required flexible problem-solving skills. My time in the Probation Service developed my strong
                        communication skills, due to regularly engaging with a wide range of internal and external stakeholders.
                        The two management roles I held taught me how to effectively manage, train and motivate people.
                        I then spent some time developing my project management skills within local councils, wherein my exposure
                        to programmes alike Business Objects and SQL ignited my passion for programming.

                        For the past year I have been working as a Full Stack developer working mainly with Laravel Frameworks.
                        The role taught me how to be proficient in Laravel, PHP and SQL.  I gained experience using different
                        JavaScript packages, Unit PHP testing, upgrading Laravel and PHP versions, Hosting and maintaining
                        staging and master sites and using Git command line.
